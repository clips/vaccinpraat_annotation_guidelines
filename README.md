## Vaccinpraat Annotation Guidelines

This repository contains the annotation guidelines for the Vaccinpraat project (www.vaccinpraat.uantwerpen.be), which is described in ["Vaccinpraat: Monitoring Vaccine Skepticism in Dutch Twitter and Facebook Comments"](https://clinjournal.org/clinj/article/view/134). The guidelines contain definitions and decision making cues for determining the stance towards vaccines in social media comments, the arguments used for supporting anti-vaccination opinions, and the region of origin of the comment.
